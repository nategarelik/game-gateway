# Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Unity Agent MCP system architecture, explaining how the different components work together to enable AI-driven game development.

## System Architecture

The Unity Agent MCP system consists of the following main components:

1. **MCP Server**: The central coordination server that manages communication between agents and Unity
2. **Specialized Agents**: AI agents with specific roles and capabilities
3. **Unity Integration**: A Unity package that allows Unity projects to communicate with the MCP server
4. **Toolchains**: Integrations with external tools and services
5. **Workflows**: Predefined sequences of operations for common tasks

## Component Details

### MCP Server

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is the central hub of the system. It:

- Manages communication between agents and Unity
- Orchestrates complex workflows involving multiple agents
- Maintains state across agent interactions
- Provides a REST API for external integrations

Key components of the MCP server include:

- **Server Core**: The main server implementation, handling HTTP requests and responses
- **Prompt Registry**: Manages prompt templates for different agents and tasks
- **State Manager**: Maintains state across agent interactions using LangGraph
- **API Routes**: Defines the REST API endpoints for external integrations

### Specialized Agents

The system includes several specialized agents, each with a specific role:

#### Level Architect Agent

The Level Architect Agent is responsible for scene creation and modification. It:

- Generates scene layouts based on descriptions
- Modifies existing scenes based on instructions
- Places objects and defines spatial relationships
- Ensures scenes meet specified constraints

#### Code Weaver Agent

The Code Weaver Agent is responsible for code generation and implementation. It:

- Generates C# scripts based on descriptions
- Implements game mechanics and behaviors
- Refactors and optimizes existing code
- Ensures code follows best practices and project conventions

#### Documentation Sentinel Agent

The Documentation Sentinel Agent is responsible for documentation management. It:

- Generates documentation for code and assets
- Keeps documentation up to date as the project evolves
- Ensures documentation follows project standards
- Identifies areas that need better documentation

#### Pixel Forge Agent

The Pixel Forge Agent is responsible for asset placement and organization. It:

- Places assets in scenes based on descriptions
- Organizes assets according to project conventions
- Ensures visual consistency across the project
- Optimizes asset usage for performance

### Unity Integration

The Unity integration package allows Unity projects to communicate with the MCP server. It includes:

- **MCP Client**: A runtime component for communicating with the MCP server
- **Editor Windows**: Custom editor windows for configuring the MCP connection and interacting with agents
- **Utility Scripts**: Helper scripts for common tasks

### Toolchains

The system integrates with various external tools and services:

- **Unity Muse Bridge**: Integrates with Unity Muse for AI-assisted content creation
- **Retro Diffusion Bridge**: Integrates with Retro Diffusion for pixel art generation
- **Unity Bridge**: Provides direct control over the Unity Editor

### Workflows

The system includes predefined workflows for common tasks:

- **Autonomous Iteration**: Automatically iterates on game elements based on feedback
- **Advanced Collaboration**: Enables collaboration between multiple agents
- **Emergent Behavior Protocols**: Handles complex interactions between agents

## Data Flow

The typical data flow in the system is as follows:

1. A user interacts with the Unity Editor and sends a request to an agent
2. The Unity integration package forwards the request to the MCP server
3. The MCP server routes the request to the appropriate agent
4. The agent processes the request and generates a response
5. The MCP server forwards the response back to Unity
6. The Unity integration package applies the changes to the Unity project

For more complex workflows, multiple agents may be involved, with the MCP server orchestrating their interactions.

## Communication Protocols

The system uses several communication protocols:

- **HTTP/REST**: For communication between Unity and the MCP server
- **JSON**: For structured data exchange
- **Prompt-based Communication**: For interaction with AI models
- **Advanced Collaboration Protocols**: For complex multi-agent interactions

## Extensibility

The system is designed to be extensible:

- **New Agents**: Additional specialized agents can be added to the system
- **New Toolchains**: Integrations with additional tools and services can be added
- **Custom Workflows**: New workflows can be defined for specific tasks
- **Plugin System**: External plugins can extend the system's capabilities

## Security Considerations

The system includes several security features:

- **Authentication**: API endpoints can require authentication
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before processing
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Code generation and execution are sandboxed
- **Logging**: All operations are logged for audit purposes

## Performance Considerations

The system is designed for performance:

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Long-running tasks are processed asynchronously
- **Caching**: Frequently used data is cached for faster access
- **Batched Operations**: Multiple operations can be batched for efficiency
- **Resource Management**: System resources are managed to prevent overload

## Future Directions

Planned future enhancements include:

- **Additional Specialized Agents**: More agents for specific tasks
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Improved multi-agent collaboration
- **Advanced Learning**: Agents that learn from user feedback
- **Expanded Toolchain Integrations**: More integrations with external tools
