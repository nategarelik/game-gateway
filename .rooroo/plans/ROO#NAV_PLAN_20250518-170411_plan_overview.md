This document outlines the sub-tasks generated to begin the implementation of the Autonomous AI Agent Ecosystem for Game Development.

## Parent Task:
ROO#NAV_PLAN_20250518-170411: "Please get started building my project. I have outlined a plan '.rooroo/plans/ROO#20250517-041757-PLAN_final_summary.md'"

## Sub-Tasks:

### 1. Implement Core MCP Server Infrastructure
- **Task ID:** `ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S001`
- **Goal:** Implement the core MCP server infrastructure as detailed in the provided design document. This includes defining the server's main architecture, integrating LangGraph for state management, and setting up the PromptRegistry for dynamic prompt handling.
- **Suggested Expert:** `rooroo-developer`
- **Context File:** [`context.md`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S001/context.md)
- **Depends On:** None

### 2. Implement "Level Architect" Specialized Agent
- **Task ID:** `ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S002`
- **Goal:** Implement the "Level Architect" specialized agent. This involves developing the agent's core logic, integrating its role-specific prompt templates, and defining its behavior enforcement mechanisms based on the design document. Ensure the agent can interface with the MCP server.
- **Suggested Expert:** `rooroo-developer`
- **Context File:** [`context.md`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S002/context.md)
- **Depends On:** `ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S001`

### 3. Implement "Pixel Forge" Specialized Agent
- **Task ID:** `ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S003`
- **Goal:** Implement the "Pixel Forge" specialized agent. This involves developing the agent's core logic, integrating its role-specific prompt templates, and defining its behavior enforcement mechanisms based on the design document. Ensure the agent can interface with the MCP server.
- **Suggested Expert:** `rooroo-developer`
- **Context File:** [`context.md`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S003/context.md)
- **Depends On:** `ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S001`

### 4. Implement "Documentation Sentinel" Specialized Agent
- **Task ID:** `ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S004`
- **Goal:** Implement the "Documentation Sentinel" specialized agent. This involves developing the agent's core logic, integrating its role-specific prompt templates, and defining its behavior enforcement mechanisms based on the design document. Ensure the agent can interface with the MCP server.
- **Suggested Expert:** `rooroo-developer`
- **Context File:** [`context.md`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S004/context.md)
- **Depends On:** `ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S001`

### 5. Integrate External Toolchains
- **Task ID:** `ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S005`
- **Goal:** Integrate the external toolchains (Unity Muse, Retro Diffusion Pipeline) as specified in the implementation plan. This includes building interfaces for agent interaction with these toolchains and ensuring they can be invoked and managed via the MCP server.
