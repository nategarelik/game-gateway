## Next Steps
The implementation plans are now ready for development. The next phase would involve:

1. Setting up the core MCP server infrastructure
2. Implementing the specialized agents one by one
3. Integrating the external toolchains
4. Testing the system with increasingly complex game development tasks

This project has successfully laid the groundwork for a revolutionary autonomous AI agent ecosystem for game development that combines specialized expertise, creative collaboration, and technical integration.
