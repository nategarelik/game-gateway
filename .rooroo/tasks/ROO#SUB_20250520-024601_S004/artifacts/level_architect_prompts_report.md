# Level Architect Agent Prompts & Behavior Mechanisms Report

**Task ID:** ROO#SUB_20250520-024601_S004

## Summary of Changes

This task focused on developing and refining the initial set of prompt templates and behavior enforcement mechanisms for the `LevelArchitectAgent`.

### 1. Prompt Template Definition
Three core prompt templates were defined as string constants within [`src/agents/level_architect_agent.py`](src/agents/level_architect_agent.py:0):
- `LEVEL_GENERATION_INITIAL_TEMPLATE`: For generating new levels.
- `LEVEL_STYLE_ADAPTATION_TEMPLATE`: For adapting existing level data to a new style.
- `LEVEL_CONSTRAINT_CHECK_TEMPLATE`: For reviewing a level design against constraints.

These templates are loaded into `self.prompt_templates` in the agent's `__init__` method. Required variables for each template are defined in `self.prompt_template_required_vars`.

### 2. Prompt Integration into Agent Logic
- A new method `_get_prompt_template_for_task(self, task_type: str)` was implemented to retrieve template strings. This is designed for future integration with the MCP `PromptRegistry`.
- A core method `_resolve_prompt_and_simulate_llm(self, task_type: str, task_details: dict)` was implemented. This method:
    - Selects the appropriate template.
    - Performs **behavior enforcement**: Checks if all declared required variables for the chosen template are present in `task_details`. If not, it logs an error, posts an event to the MCP, and returns an error status.
    - Formats the prompt template using variables from `task_details`.
    - Logs the fully resolved prompt.
    - Returns a **mocked/predefined structured output** that an LLM might produce, specific to the `task_type`. No actual LLM calls are made.
- The main `process_task(self, task_details: dict)` method was updated to:
    - Expect a `task_type_for_prompt` field in `task_details` to determine which prompt flow to use.
    - Call `_resolve_prompt_and_simulate_llm` to get the resolved prompt and the simulated LLM output.
    - Use the `simulated_llm_output` to drive subsequent agent logic (e.g., as input to `_generate_initial_level_structure` or to determine the outcome of style adaptation/constraint checks).

### 3. Behavior Enforcement
- Basic behavior enforcement is implemented within `_resolve_prompt_and_simulate_llm`. Before attempting to format a prompt, it verifies that all its declared required variables are available in `task_details`.
- If critical information is missing, the agent logs this and posts an "level_design_error" event to the MCP with status "prompt_error" and details about the missing variables.

### 4. Unit Tests
- A new test file [`tests/agents/test_level_architect_agent.py`](tests/agents/test_level_architect_agent.py:0) was created.
- Unit tests cover:
    - Correct initialization and loading of prompt templates.
    - Correct selection of prompt templates based on task type.
    - Successful formatting of prompts with variables.
    - Handling of missing variables for a prompt (behavior enforcement).
    - Verification that the agent's `process_task` correctly uses the (mocked) output of prompt processing in its subsequent logic.
    - Mocking of `post_event_to_mcp` to ensure error events are sent when appropriate.

## Artifacts
- Modified: [`src/agents/level_architect_agent.py`](src/agents/level_architect_agent.py:0)
- Created: [`tests/agents/test_level_architect_agent.py`](tests/agents/test_level_architect_agent.py:0)
- Created: This report ([`.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_20250520-024601_S004/artifacts/level_architect_prompts_report.md`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_20250520-024601_S004/artifacts/level_architect_prompts_report.md:0))

## Conclusion
The `LevelArchitectAgent` now has a foundational system for selecting, resolving, and (simulating) the use of prompts for different task types. Basic behavior enforcement for prompt variable availability is in place. The structure allows for future integration with a more dynamic `PromptRegistry` and actual LLM calls.
