**Parent Task ID:** ROO#PLAN_CODE_REVIEW_20250519-200706
**Sub-task ID:** ROO#SUB_PLAN_CODE_REVIEW_S011

**Goal for rooroo-developer:**
Review the Python file at `tests/test_mcp_server.py`.
1. Read the file.
2. Review for:
    * Up-to-dateness (Python 3 features, modern practices, library versions, testing frameworks).
    * Efficiency (of tests, not necessarily the code being tested unless obvious).
    * Redundancy (of test cases, test setup).
    * Proper commenting (clarity of test purpose, complex assertions).
    * Test coverage and effectiveness (are tests meaningful, do they cover critical paths and edge cases).
3. Identify areas for improvement. Suggest changes or apply straightforward, low-risk ones. Note complex changes for separate tasks.
4. List all external libraries imported/used in this file (e.g., pytest, unittest).
5. Note any test patterns or complex setups that could benefit from comparison with established best practices.

**Input File:**
*   [`tests/test_mcp_server.py`](tests/test_mcp_server.py)

**Guidance:**
*   Focus on the specific test file mentioned.
*   The output of this task should be a report detailing findings, suggestions, and any minor changes made.
