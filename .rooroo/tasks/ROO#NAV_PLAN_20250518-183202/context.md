# Planner Task: ROO#NAV_PLAN_20250518-183202
## User Request:
"Lets set it up for testing in my unity project"

## Background:
The initial phase of development for the Autonomous AI Agent Ecosystem has been completed. The following artifacts have been created:

*   **Core MCP Server:**
    *   `.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S001/mcp_server_core.py`
*   **Level Architect Agent:**
    *   `.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S002/level_architect_agent.py`
*   **Pixel Forge Agent:**
    *   `.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S003/pixel_forge_agent.py`
*   **Documentation Sentinel Agent:**
    *   `.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S004/artifacts/documentation_sentinel_agent.py`
    *   `.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S004/artifacts/dummy_sentinel_config.json`
*   **Toolchain Integrations & Protocols:**
    *   `.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S005/muse_integration.py`
    *   `.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S005/retro_diffusion_integration.py`
    *   `.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S005/negotiation_protocol_extensions.py`

The original project plan summary ([`.rooroo/plans/ROO#20250517-041757-PLAN_final_summary.md`](.rooroo/plans/ROO#20250517-041757-PLAN_final_summary.md)) mentions Unity Muse integration and the overall goal is game development. All created components are Python-based.

## Instructions for Planner:
Based on the user's request and the existing artifacts, please create a plan to set up this Python-based AI agent ecosystem for testing within a Unity project.

The plan should address, but not be limited to:
1.  **Running the MCP Server:** How and where will the Python-based MCP server ([`mcp_server_core.py`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S001/mcp_server_core.py)) be run so that a Unity project can communicate with it? (e.g., as a local HTTP server).
2.  **Unity to MCP Communication:** How will the Unity project (presumably C#) communicate with the Python MCP server? (e.g., HTTP requests, WebSockets, other IPC mechanisms).
3.  **Agent Invocation:** How will the specialized Python agents (Level Architect, Pixel Forge, Documentation Sentinel) be invoked or triggered, presumably via the MCP server, from actions or requests within the Unity project?
4.  **Toolchain Access:** The plan mentions Unity Muse integration ([`muse_integration.py`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S005/muse_integration.py)). How will this Python integration be made accessible or usable from within the Unity environment for testing?
5.  **Deployment/Setup Steps:** Outline the necessary setup steps within the Unity project and for the Python components to enable this testing environment.
6.  **Initial Test Cases:** Suggest 1-2 simple test cases that could be performed from within Unity to verify the basic communication and functionality of the MCP server and at least one agent.

Your output should be a JSON array of task objects, suitable for Rooroo experts (likely `rooroo-developer` for implementation tasks, `rooroo-architect` for high-level design if needed). Each task object must include:
- `taskId`: A new unique ID you generate.
- `summary`: A concise summary of the task.
- `goal`: A detailed goal for the expert.
- `suggested_mode`: The slug of the Rooroo expert.
- `context_files`: An array of paths to relevant existing artifacts or plan documents.
- `dependencies`: An array of `taskId`s that this task depends on.

The final output in the `new_task` result's `message` field should be a JSON string containing an object like:
`{\"status\": \"Done\", \"queue_tasks_json_lines\": \"[json_task_object_1]\\n[json_task_object_2]\\n...\"}`
or
`{\"status\": \"Advice\", \"message\": \"reason_for_advice\", \"advice_details\": {\"suggested_mode\": \"rooroo-some-expert\", \"refined_goal\": \"new_goal\"}}`
