# Sub-Task: Implement MuseToolchainBridge Core Logic

**Parent Task ID:** ROO#NAV_PROJECT_SETUP_PLAN_20250519-182251
**Sub-Task ID:** ROO#SUB_182251_S008
**Depends On:** ROO#SUB_182251_S004 (ensures bridge file is in [`src/toolchains/muse_bridge.py`](src/toolchains/muse_bridge.py))

**Goal:**
Implement the core functionality for the `MuseToolchainBridge` located in [`src/toolchains/muse_bridge.py`](src/toolchains/muse_bridge.py). This involves defining methods to interact with the (potentially mocked) Muse API or service.

**Key File:**
*   Bridge Code: [`src/toolchains/muse_bridge.py`](src/toolchains/muse_bridge.py)

**Instructions:**
1.  **Define Interaction Methods:**
    *   Identify the key operations the `LevelArchitectAgent` (or other components) will need from Muse (e.g., `generate_level_layout(params)`, `get_asset_suggestions(theme)`).
    *   Implement methods in `MuseToolchainBridge` for these operations.
    *   These methods will take relevant parameters and should return data in a format usable by the calling agent.
2.  **API Integration (or Mocking):**
    *   If the Muse API details are known, implement the actual API calls (e.g., using `requests` library). Handle API keys and error responses appropriately.
    *   If the API is not yet available or for simpler initial development, implement mock responses. For example, a `generate_level_layout` method might return a predefined JSON structure. Clearly mark mocks with `TODO: Implement real API call`.
3.  **Imports:**
    *   Verify and ensure all import statements are correct. Add `requests` to `requirements.txt` if used.
4.  **Configuration:**
    *   Consider how API keys or service endpoints would be configured (e.g., environment variables, configuration file). For now, hardcoding with a `TODO:` for proper configuration is acceptable.
