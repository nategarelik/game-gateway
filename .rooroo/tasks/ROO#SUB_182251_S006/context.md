# Sub-Task: Implement PixelForgeAgent Core Logic

**Parent Task ID:** ROO#NAV_PROJECT_SETUP_PLAN_20250519-182251
**Sub-Task ID:** ROO#SUB_182251_S006
**Depends On:** ROO#SUB_182251_S003 (ensures agent file is in [`src/agents/pixel_forge.py`](src/agents/pixel_forge.py))

**Goal:**
Implement the full core functionality for the `PixelForgeAgent` located in [`src/agents/pixel_forge.py`](src/agents/pixel_forge.py). This involves implementing its direct request handling and its participation in stateful workflows.

**Key File:**
*   Agent Code: [`src/agents/pixel_forge.py`](src/agents/pixel_forge.py)

**Design Document Reference:**
*   Refer to the general agent design principles in the parent context ([`.rooroo/tasks/ROO#NAV_PROJECT_SETUP_PLAN_20250519-182251/context.md`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#NAV_PROJECT_SETUP_PLAN_20250519-182251/context.md)) and any specific design notes for `PixelForgeAgent` if available from previous tasks (e.g., potentially in a document like `specialized_agent_roles_and_prompt_systems.md` if it covers this agent). Assume it interacts with `RetroDiffusionToolchainBridge`.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Implement `handle_direct_request(self, request_data: dict)`:**
    *   Implement the logic to process direct requests. This will likely involve interpreting `request_data` (e.g., image generation parameters), interacting with the `RetroDiffusionToolchainBridge` (via [`src/toolchains/retro_diffusion_bridge.py`](src/toolchains/retro_diffusion_bridge.py)), and formatting a response (e.g., path to generated image or image data).
2.  **Implement `execute(self, state: GameDevState)`:**
    *   Implement the logic for the agent to participate in a multi-step workflow. This method will receive a `GameDevState` object and should act based on its role (e.g., generating textures or sprites based on state).
3.  **Imports:**
    *   Verify and ensure all import statements are correct (e.g., `from ..toolchains.retro_diffusion_bridge import RetroDiffusionToolchainBridge`).
4.  **Placeholders:**
    *   Use mocked responses or placeholder logic for actual toolchain calls if full integration is deferred, marking with `TODO:`.
