# Level Architect Agent Structure Definition Report

**Task ID:** ROO#SUB_20250520-024601_S001

## Summary
The foundational Python class structure for the `LevelArchitectAgent` has been successfully defined. This involved the creation and/or modification of the following files:

1.  **[`src/agents/base_agent.py`](src/agents/base_agent.py:0):** Created with the `BaseAgent` class, providing common functionalities for all agents, including MCP communication (registration, event posting) and a base `process_task` method.
2.  **[`src/agents/level_architect_agent.py`](src/agents/level_architect_agent.py:0):** Created with the `LevelArchitectAgent` class, inheriting from `BaseAgent`. It includes an `__init__` method for specific configurations (e.g., `level_design_tool_config`) and capabilities (`level_design`, `procedural_generation_guidance`). A placeholder `process_task` method and specific placeholder methods (`generate_level_layout`, `refine_level_design`) have been implemented.
3.  **[`src/agents/__init__.py`](src/agents/__init__.py:0):** Created to ensure `BaseAgent` and `LevelArchitectAgent` are easily importable from the `src.agents` package.

All specified class structures, initial configurations, and necessary imports have been set up as per the task requirements.
