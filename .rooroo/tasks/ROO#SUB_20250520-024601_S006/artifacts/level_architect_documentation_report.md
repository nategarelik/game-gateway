# Level Architect Agent Documentation Report - ROO#SUB_20250520-024601_S006

**Task ID:** ROO#SUB_20250520-024601_S006
**Goal:** Create comprehensive documentation for the `LevelArchitectAgent`.

**Summary:**
Comprehensive documentation for the `LevelArchitectAgent` has been created and written to [`docs/agents/level_architect.md`](docs/agents/level_architect.md:0).

The documentation covers the following key areas:
- Overview of the agent's purpose and capabilities.
- Architecture, including inheritance from `BaseAgent` and key internal methods.
- Configuration parameters for instantiation.
- Usage details, including how tasks are assigned via the MCP and the expected input/output formats for `process_task`.
- Prompt strategies, listing core templates and expected variables.
- Integration with the MCP Server for registration and event reporting.
- Interaction with external tools (noting the current placeholder status).
- Error handling mechanisms.
- A Python code example demonstrating agent instantiation and mock task processing.

The content was generated based on the analysis of the agent's source code ([`src/agents/level_architect_agent.py`](src/agents/level_architect_agent.py:0)), the base agent code ([`src/agents/base_agent.py`](src/agents/base_agent.py:0)), and the task context provided in `.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_20250520-024601_S006/context.md`.

**Output Artifacts:**
- [`docs/agents/level_architect.md`](docs/agents/level_architect.md:0) (Updated/Created Documentation)
- `.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_20250520-024601_S006/artifacts/level_architect_documentation_report.md` (This Report)
