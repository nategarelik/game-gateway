# Sub-Task: Develop Basic Tests for an Agent (e.g., DocumentationSentinel)

**Parent Task ID:** ROO#NAV_PROJECT_SETUP_PLAN_20250519-182251
**Sub-Task ID:** ROO#SUB_182251_S018
**Depends On:** ROO#SUB_182251_S007 (ensures `DocumentationSentinelAgent` logic is implemented at [`src/agents/documentation_sentinel.py`](src/agents/documentation_sentinel.py))

**Goal:**
Develop basic unit test scripts (e.g., using `pytest`) or outline manual test procedures for one of the specialized agents. As an example, this task focuses on `DocumentationSentinelAgent`. Test scripts can be placed in a new file like [`tests/agents/test_documentation_sentinel.py`](tests/agents/test_documentation_sentinel.py).

**Key File to Test:**
*   Agent Code: [`src/agents/documentation_sentinel.py`](src/agents/documentation_sentinel.py)

**Target Test File (Example):**
*   [`tests/agents/test_documentation_sentinel.py`](tests/agents/test_documentation_sentinel.py) (Developer to create)

**Instructions:**
1.  **Focus on Unit Tests:**
    *   For the chosen agent (e.g., `DocumentationSentinelAgent`), write unit tests for its core methods (`handle_direct_request`, `execute`).
2.  **Mock Dependencies:**
    *   Mock any external dependencies, such as file system interactions (e.g., use `unittest.mock.patch` or `pytest-mock` to mock `open`, `os.path.exists`, etc.) or interactions with other components (e.g., if it calls an MCP client or a toolchain bridge directly, mock those calls).
    *   The goal is to test the agent's logic in isolation.
3.  **Test `handle_direct_request`:**
    *   Provide mock `request_data`.
    *   Verify the agent processes the data correctly.
    *   Verify the structure and content of the response.
    *   If it's supposed to write a file, mock the file write and check that the correct content *would have been* written to the correct path.
4.  **Test `execute` (if applicable and testable in isolation):**
    *   Provide a mock `GameDevState`.
    *   Verify the agent's logic based on the state.
    *   Verify any changes to the state or outputs produced.
5.  **Manual Test Procedures (Alternative/Complementary):**
    *   If automated unit tests are challenging, outline steps to manually instantiate the agent (if possible outside the MCP server) and call its methods with sample inputs, then check outputs or side effects.
6.  **Documentation:**
    *   Ensure tests are clear and self-explanatory. Notes on running agent-specific tests can be added to the agent's own documentation file or the main project README.
