# Level Architect Agent Unit Test Implementation Report

**Task ID:** ROO#SUB_20250520-024601_S005

## Summary
Comprehensive unit tests for the `LevelArchitectAgent` have been implemented in the file [`tests/agents/test_level_architect_agent.py`](tests/agents/test_level_architect_agent.py:0).

The tests cover:
- Agent initialization and configuration.
- Core logic for processing different task types (`level_generation_initial`, `level_style_adaptation`, `level_constraint_check`).
- Prompt template handling, including selection and variable resolution.
- Mocked interaction points with the MCP server, specifically for `register_with_mcp` and `post_event_to_mcp` methods inherited from `BaseAgent`.
- Error handling for various scenarios, such as missing prompt variables, unknown task types, and simulated HTTP errors during MCP communication.
- Asynchronous test execution using `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio`.

The tests utilize `pytest` fixtures for setting up test instances and `unittest.mock` (specifically `AsyncMock`, `MagicMock`) for mocking dependencies like `httpx.AsyncClient` and internal agent helper methods. This ensures that tests are isolated and focus on the specific logic of the `LevelArchitectAgent`.
