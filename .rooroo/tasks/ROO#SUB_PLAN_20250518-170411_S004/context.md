# Sub-Task: ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S004
## Parent Task: ROO#NAV_PLAN_20250518-170411
## Goal for Expert (rooroo-developer):
Implement the "Documentation Sentinel" specialized agent. This involves developing the agent's core logic, integrating its role-specific prompt templates, and defining its behavior enforcement mechanisms based on the design document. Ensure the agent can interface with the MCP server.

## Key Design Document:
- [`specialized_agent_roles_and_prompt_systems.md`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_S002/specialized_agent_roles_and_prompt_systems.md) (Focus on Documentation Sentinel sections)
- [`real_time_doc_processing_implementation_plan.md`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_S006/real_time_doc_processing_implementation_plan.md) (For knowledge management aspects)

## Dependencies:
- ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S001 (Core MCP Server Implementation)

## Expected Outcome:
A functional "Documentation Sentinel" agent capable of performing its designated tasks, including real-time document processing, and communicating with the MCP server.
