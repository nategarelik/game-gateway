# Sub-Task: Implement DocumentationSentinelAgent Core Logic

**Parent Task ID:** ROO#NAV_PROJECT_SETUP_PLAN_20250519-182251
**Sub-Task ID:** ROO#SUB_182251_S007
**Depends On:** ROO#SUB_182251_S003 (ensures agent file is in [`src/agents/documentation_sentinel.py`](src/agents/documentation_sentinel.py))

**Goal:**
Implement the full core functionality for the `DocumentationSentinelAgent` located in [`src/agents/documentation_sentinel.py`](src/agents/documentation_sentinel.py). This involves implementing its direct request handling and its participation in stateful workflows.

**Key File:**
*   Agent Code: [`src/agents/documentation_sentinel.py`](src/agents/documentation_sentinel.py)

**Design Document Reference:**
*   Refer to the general agent design principles in the parent context ([`.rooroo/tasks/ROO#NAV_PROJECT_SETUP_PLAN_20250519-182251/context.md`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#NAV_PROJECT_SETUP_PLAN_20250519-182251/context.md)).
*   Its primary role is to generate or update documentation based on requests or game state changes. It might need to read project files or receive structured data about components to document.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Implement `handle_direct_request(self, request_data: dict)`:**
    *   Implement logic to process requests, e.g., "generate docs for component X" or "update overall project README."
    *   This might involve reading specified source files, analyzing them (perhaps with simplified heuristics or by calling another specialized tool/agent in the future), and generating Markdown content.
2.  **Implement `execute(self, state: GameDevState)`:**
    *   Implement logic for stateful participation. For example, if a new component is added to the `GameDevState`, this agent could trigger documentation generation for it.
3.  **Imports:**
    *   Verify and ensure all import statements are correct.
4.  **File I/O:**
    *   This agent will likely need to write to files in the `docs/` directory. Ensure paths are handled correctly (e.g., [`docs/agents/some_agent.md`](docs/agents/some_agent.md)).
