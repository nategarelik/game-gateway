# Sub-Task: Implement LevelArchitectAgent Core Logic

**Parent Task ID:** ROO#NAV_PROJECT_SETUP_PLAN_20250519-182251
**Sub-Task ID:** ROO#SUB_182251_S005
**Depends On:** ROO#SUB_182251_S003 (ensures agent file is in the correct location: [`src/agents/level_architect.py`](src/agents/level_architect.py))

**Goal:**
Implement the full core functionality for the `LevelArchitectAgent` located in [`src/agents/level_architect.py`](src/agents/level_architect.py). This involves implementing its direct request handling and its participation in stateful workflows.

**Key File:**
*   Agent Code: [`src/agents/level_architect.py`](src/agents/level_architect.py) (assumed moved and imports initially adjusted by ROO#SUB_182251_S003)

**Design Document Reference:**
*   The specific design, expected inputs, and outputs for `LevelArchitectAgent` are detailed in [`.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_S002/specialized_agent_roles_and_prompt_systems.md`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_S002/specialized_agent_roles_and_prompt_systems.md). (Note: This path might be from a previous plan; the content is key).

**Instructions:**
1.  **Implement `handle_direct_request(self, request_data: dict)`:**
    *   Based on the design document, implement the logic to process direct requests. This might involve interpreting `request_data`, interacting with toolchains (e.g., Muse via its bridge), and formatting a response.
    *   Ensure any necessary helper methods are created within the class.
2.  **Implement `execute(self, state: GameDevState)`:**
    *   Implement the logic for the agent to participate in a multi-step workflow managed by the MCP server's `StateGraph`.
    *   This method will receive a `GameDevState` object (assume its structure or define a basic one if not yet available from MCP server implementation) and should update it or produce outputs based on its role in the workflow.
3.  **Imports:**
    *   Verify and ensure all import statements are correct, reflecting the new project structure (e.g., `from ..toolchains.muse_bridge import MuseToolchainBridge`, `from ..mcp_server.client import ...`).
4.  **Placeholders:**
    *   If actual toolchain integration is complex, use mocked responses or placeholder logic for now, clearly marking them with `TODO:` comments.
