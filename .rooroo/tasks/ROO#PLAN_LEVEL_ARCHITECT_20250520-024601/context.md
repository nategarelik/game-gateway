# Task: Plan Implementation of Level Architect Agent

**Task ID:** ROO#PLAN_LEVEL_ARCHITECT_20250520-024601
**Parent Project Plan:** `.rooroo/plans/ROO#20250517-041757-PLAN_final_summary.md`

**Goal for rooroo-planner:**
Based on the overall project plan ([`.rooroo/plans/ROO#20250517-041757-PLAN_final_summary.md`](.rooroo/plans/ROO#20250517-041757-PLAN_final_summary.md:0)), the next major phase after MCP server setup is "Implementing the specialized agents one by one". Your task is to create a detailed, actionable sub-plan for implementing the first specialized agent: the **Level Architect**.

**Key Objectives for this Planning Phase:**
1.  Identify all necessary components and sub-tasks required to implement the Level Architect agent.
2.  Consider dependencies between these sub-tasks and integration points with the MCP server.
3.  For each sub-task, define a clear goal, suggest an appropriate Rooroo expert (e.g., `rooroo-developer`, `rooroo-documenter`), and estimate complexity if possible.
4.  The output should be a list of tasks in JSONL format suitable for adding to the `.rooroo/queue.jsonl` file.
5.  Refer to the "Specialized Agent Roles & Prompt Systems" section (lines 13-17) and the artifact [`.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_S002/specialized_agent_roles_and_prompt_systems.md`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_S002/specialized_agent_roles_and_prompt_systems.md:0) from the main plan for detailed specifications regarding the Level Architect agent.

# Autonomous AI Agent Ecosystem for Game Development: Implementation Plan Summary
...
### 2. Specialized Agent Roles & Prompt Systems
- Designed Level Architect, Pixel Forge, and Documentation Sentinel agents
- Created role-specific prompt templates and behavior enforcement mechanisms
- Outlined integration points between specialized agents
...
## Next Steps
The implementation plans are now ready for development. The next phase would involve:
1. Setting up the core MCP server infrastructure (Completed)
2. Implementing the specialized agents one by one
3. Integrating the external toolchains
4. Testing the system with increasingly complex game development tasks
```

**Expected Output from Planner:**
*   A JSON object in the `result` field of the `attempt_completion` call, containing:
    *   `status`: "Done" or "Failed"
    *   `message`: Concise summary.
    *   `queue_tasks_json_lines` (string): A string containing multiple JSON objects, each on a new line, representing tasks for the queue. Each JSON object should include `taskId`, `parentTaskId` (set to `ROO#PLAN_LEVEL_ARCHITECT_20250520-024601`), `suggested_mode`, `context_file_path` (for a new context file you'll specify for that sub-task), and `goal_for_expert`.
    *   `output_artifact_paths`: Path to a markdown file summarizing the plan (e.g., `.rooroo/plans/ROO#PLAN_LEVEL_ARCHITECT_20250520-024601_summary.md`).

Please create a robust plan for the implementation of the Level Architect agent.
