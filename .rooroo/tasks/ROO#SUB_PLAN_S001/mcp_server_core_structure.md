# MCP Server Core Structure

## Overview
The MCP (Master Control Program) Server serves as the central coordination hub for the autonomous AI agent ecosystem for game development. It manages state transitions, agent communication, and prompt resolution across the distributed network of specialized AI agents.

## Core Components

### 1. MCPServer Class
The primary class that initializes and manages the entire system.

```python
class MCPServer:  
    def __init__(self):  
        self.workflow = StateGraph(GameDevState)  
        self.prompt_engine = PromptRegistry()  

    def register_agent(self, agent: Agent):  
        self.workflow.add_node(agent.role, agent.execute)  
        self.prompt_engine.add_template(agent.role, agent.prompt_template)  
```

#### Key Responsibilities:
- Initialize the state management system (LangGraph)
- Initialize the prompt registry
- Register agents into the workflow
- Store agent prompt templates for dynamic resolution

### 2. StateGraph (LangGraph Integration)
Manages the state transitions and workflow between different agents.

```python
# Conceptual structure
class GameDevState:
    """State object that tracks the current state of the game development process"""
    project_metadata: dict
    assets: dict
    current_tasks: list
    completed_tasks: list
    agent_states: dict
```

#### Key Responsibilities:
- Track the current state of the game development process
- Manage transitions between agent nodes
- Maintain a consistent state across all agents
- Handle conditional branching based on agent outputs

### 3. PromptRegistry
Manages dynamic prompt templates and their resolution.

```python
class PromptRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.templates = {}
        
    def add_template(self, role, template):
        self.templates[role] = template
        
    def get_template(self, role):
        return self.templates.get(role)
        
    def resolve_prompt(self, template, variables):
        return "\n".join([
            line for line in template
            if all(var in variables for var in re.findall(r'\{\{(\w+)\}\}', line))
        ])
```

#### Key Responsibilities:
- Store prompt templates for each agent role
- Resolve dynamic prompts based on available variables
- Conditional line inclusion in prompts
- Maintain consistency in agent communication

### 4. Agent Interface
The standard interface that all specialized agents must implement.

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, role, prompt_template):
        self.role = role
        self.prompt_template = prompt_template
        
    def execute(self, state: GameDevState) -> GameDevState:
        """Execute the agent's task and update the state"""
        pass
```

#### Key Responsibilities:
- Define the standard interface for all agents
- Provide execution method that takes and returns state
- Store role and prompt template information

## Integration Points

### 1. LangGraph Integration
The MCP Server integrates with LangGraph for state management through the following points:

1. **StateGraph Initialization**:
   ```python
   self.workflow = StateGraph(GameDevState)
   ```
   - Creates a directed graph for workflow management
   - Uses GameDevState as the state object

2. **Node Registration**:
   ```python
   self.workflow.add_node(agent.role, agent.execute)
   ```
   - Registers each agent as a node in the workflow graph
   - Associates the agent's execute method with the node

3. **State Transitions**:
   ```python
   # Conceptual implementation
   def add_transition(self, from_role, to_role, condition=None):
       self.workflow.add_edge(from_role, to_role, condition)
   ```
   - Defines the possible transitions between agent nodes
   - Can include conditional logic for dynamic routing

4. **Workflow Execution**:
   ```python
   # Conceptual implementation
   def execute_workflow(self, initial_state):
       return self.workflow.run(initial_state)
   ```
   - Runs the entire workflow with an initial state
   - Returns the final state after all transitions

### 2. PromptRegistry Integration
The MCP Server integrates with the PromptRegistry for dynamic prompt handling through:

1. **Template Registration**:
   ```python
   self.prompt_engine.add_template(agent.role, agent.prompt_template)
   ```
   - Stores prompt templates associated with each agent role

2. **Dynamic Prompt Resolution**:
   ```python
   def resolve_prompt(template, variables):
       return "\n".join([
           line for line in template
           if all(var in variables for var in re.findall(r'\{\{(\w+)\}\}', line))
       ])
   ```
   - Resolves templates with variable substitution
   - Conditionally includes lines based on variable availability

3. **Prompt Retrieval**:
   ```python
   # Conceptual implementation
   def get_prompt_for_agent(self, role, variables):
       template = self.prompt_engine.get_template(role)
       return self.prompt_engine.resolve_prompt(template, variables)
   ```
   - Retrieves and resolves prompts for specific agent roles
   - Passes current state variables for dynamic resolution

## Communication Flow

1. **Agent Registration**:
   - Agents register with the MCP Server
   - Their roles and prompt templates are stored

2. **Workflow Definition**:
   - The MCP Server defines possible transitions between agents
   - Conditions for transitions are specified

3. **Execution**:
   - The workflow starts with an initial state
   - Each agent node processes the state and returns an updated state
   - The workflow transitions to the next node based on defined edges
   - The process continues until a terminal state is reached

4. **Dynamic Prompt Resolution**:
   - When an agent needs to execute, its prompt template is retrieved
   - The template is resolved with current state variables
   - The resolved prompt is used for the agent's execution

5. **Multi-Agent Negotiation**:
   - For complex decisions, multiple agents can bid on tasks
   - The MCP Server arbitrates between competing bids
   - Results are cached for future reference

## Extension Points

1. **New Agent Types**:
   - Implement the Agent interface
   - Register with the MCP Server

2. **Custom State Transitions**:
   - Define new edges in the workflow graph
   - Implement custom conditions for transitions

3. **Enhanced Prompt Templates**:
   - Extend the prompt resolution logic
   - Add support for more complex template features

4. **External Tool Integration**:
   - Add bridges to tools like Unity Muse
   - Implement validation middleware for style enforcement

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Concurrency**:
   - Consider thread safety for concurrent agent execution
   - Implement locking mechanisms for shared state access

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Define recovery strategies for agent failures
   - Implement retry logic for transient errors

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Add telemetry for workflow execution
   - Track performance metrics for optimization

4. **Persistence**:
   - Consider state persistence for long-running workflows
   - Implement checkpointing for recovery

## Conclusion

The MCP Server provides a robust framework for coordinating specialized AI agents in game development. By leveraging LangGraph for state management and the PromptRegistry for dynamic prompt handling, it enables complex workflows with clear separation of concerns. The modular design allows for easy extension with new agent types and integration with external tools.
