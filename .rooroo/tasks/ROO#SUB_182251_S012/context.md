# Sub-Task: Document LevelArchitectAgent

**Parent Task ID:** ROO#NAV_PROJECT_SETUP_PLAN_20250519-182251
**Sub-Task ID:** ROO#SUB_182251_S012
**Depends On:** 
*   ROO#SUB_182251_S003 (ensures agent file is at [`src/agents/level_architect.py`](src/agents/level_architect.py))
*   ROO#SUB_182251_S005 (ensures agent logic is implemented)

**Goal:**
Create detailed Markdown documentation for the `LevelArchitectAgent`. The documentation should be placed in [`docs/agents/level_architect.md`](docs/agents/level_architect.md).

**Key File to Document:**
*   Agent Code: [`src/agents/level_architect.py`](src/agents/level_architect.py)

**Target Documentation File:**
*   [`docs/agents/level_architect.md`](docs/agents/level_architect.md)

**Content Requirements:**
1.  **Title:** "LevelArchitectAgent Documentation"
2.  **Purpose:** Describe the agent's role in level design, procedural generation, or layout assistance.
3.  **Core Methods:**
    *   **`handle_direct_request(self, request_data: dict)`:**
        *   Expected `request_data` structure and parameters.
        *   Logic performed by the agent.
        *   Format of the returned response.
    *   **`execute(self, state: GameDevState)`:**
        *   How the agent uses/modifies the `GameDevState`.
        *   Its role in a larger workflow.
4.  **Toolchain Interaction:**
    *   Detail its interaction with `MuseToolchainBridge` ([`src/toolchains/muse_bridge.py`](src/toolchains/muse_bridge.py)).
    *   What methods on the bridge it calls and for what purpose.
5.  **Configuration (if any):**
    *   Any specific configuration options for this agent.
6.  **Example Usage (Conceptual):**
    *   A brief example of how one might request level generation or advice from this agent.

**Instructions for Documenter:**
*   Refer to the agent's code in [`src/agents/level_architect.py`](src/agents/level_architect.py).
*   Refer to its design document: [`.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_S002/specialized_agent_roles_and_prompt_systems.md`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_S002/specialized_agent_roles_and_prompt_systems.md).
*   Refer to the parent task context ([`.rooroo/tasks/ROO#NAV_PROJECT_SETUP_PLAN_20250519-182251/context.md`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#NAV_PROJECT_SETUP_PLAN_20250519-182251/context.md)).
