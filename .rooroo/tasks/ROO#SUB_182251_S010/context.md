# Sub-Task: Create Project Root README.md

**Parent Task ID:** ROO#NAV_PROJECT_SETUP_PLAN_20250519-182251
**Sub-Task ID:** ROO#SUB_182251_S010
**Depends On:** ROO#SUB_182251_S001 (ensures project structure is initiated)

**Goal:**
Create a comprehensive `README.md` file in the project root directory (`c:/Users/Nate2/UnityAgent/README.md`). This file will serve as the main entry point for understanding the AI Agent Ecosystem project.

**Target File:**
*   [`README.md`](README.md) (in project root)

**Content Requirements for `README.md`:**
1.  **Project Title:** Clear and descriptive.
2.  **Overview:** Briefly explain what the AI Agent Ecosystem is, its purpose, and its intended use (e.g., game development assistance).
3.  **Architecture:**
    *   High-level description of the main components:
        *   MCP (Master Control Program) Server: Role in orchestrating agents and workflows.
        *   Specialized Agents (LevelArchitect, PixelForge, DocumentationSentinel): Briefly describe each agent's function.
        *   Toolchain Bridges (Muse, RetroDiffusion): Explain their role in connecting to external tools/services.
    *   A simple diagram or textual representation of how these components interact would be beneficial.
4.  **Project Structure:**
    *   Briefly explain the layout of the `src/`, `docs/`, `tests/` directories.
5.  **Setup Instructions:**
    *   How to set up the development environment.
    *   Cloning the repository (if applicable).
    *   Installing dependencies (referencing `requirements.txt`).
    *   Any necessary configuration (e.g., API keys for toolchains - mention where to configure them, perhaps via environment variables).
6.  **Running the System:**
    *   How to start the MCP server.
    *   How to interact with agents (e.g., example API calls to `/execute_agent` endpoint).
7.  **Running Tests:**
    *   Instructions on how to run any available tests (once test tasks are completed).
8.  **Contributing (Optional but good):**
    *   Brief notes if contributions are welcome.

**Instructions for Documenter:**
*   Gather information from the parent task context ([`.rooroo/tasks/ROO#NAV_PROJECT_SETUP_PLAN_20250519-182251/context.md`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#NAV_PROJECT_SETUP_PLAN_20250519-182251/context.md)) and the structure defined in ROO#SUB_182251_S001.
*   Write clear, concise, and well-formatted Markdown.
*   Assume the reader has some technical background but may be new to this specific project.
