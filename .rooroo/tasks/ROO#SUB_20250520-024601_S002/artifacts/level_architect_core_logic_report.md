# Report: LevelArchitectAgent Core Logic Implementation

**Task ID:** ROO#SUB_20250520-024601_S002
**Agent File:** [`src/agents/level_architect_agent.py`](src/agents/level_architect_agent.py:0)

## Implemented Logic:

The core logic for the `LevelArchitectAgent` has been implemented within the `process_task` method and several helper methods. The implementation focuses on establishing the internal workflow for processing level design tasks, with placeholders for complex operations like LLM-based prompt interpretation and actual external tool interactions.

### 1. `process_task(self, task_details: dict) -> dict`
   - This is the main entry point for handling level design tasks.
   - It orchestrates the level design process by calling helper methods.
   - **Input:** `task_details` (dictionary containing `task_id`, `prompt`, `theme`, `constraints`, `context_data`).
   - **Workflow:**
     1. Initializes logging and posts a "started" event to the MCP server.
     2. Calls `_interpret_design_prompt` to get structured design goals.
     3. Calls `_generate_initial_level_structure` based on these goals.
     4. Calls `_apply_theme_and_constraints` to modify the structure.
     5. (Placeholder) Conditionally calls `_interact_with_external_tool` if `design_goals` indicate a need.
     6. Posts progress events to MCP at each significant step.
     7. Returns a dictionary with `status`, `message`, and `output` (the final level data).
   - **Error Handling:** Includes a try-except block to catch exceptions, log them, post an error event to MCP, and return a failure status.

### 2. Helper Methods (Async):
   - **`_interpret_design_prompt(self, prompt: str, context: dict) -> dict`:**
     - **Purpose:** To parse the natural language prompt and extract structured design parameters.
     - **Current Implementation:** Placeholder logic. Performs simple keyword matching (e.g., "dungeon", "small", "traps", "secret room") to populate a `design_goals` dictionary.
     - **Future Enhancement:** Intended to be replaced with more sophisticated NLP/LLM-based interpretation.
   - **`_generate_initial_level_structure(self, design_goals: dict) -> dict`:**
     - **Purpose:** To create a basic data structure for the level based on the interpreted design goals.
     - **Current Implementation:** Placeholder logic. Returns a predefined simple structure (list of rooms, connections) and may add a "boss_chamber" if `level_type` is "dungeon".
     - **Future Enhancement:** Could involve more complex procedural generation algorithms or selection from templates.
   - **`_apply_theme_and_constraints(self, level_structure: dict, theme: str, constraints: list) -> dict`:**
     - **Purpose:** To modify the initial level structure according to the specified theme and constraints.
     - **Current Implementation:** Placeholder logic. Adds `theme_applied` and `constraints_considered` keys to the structure. Includes a note about a naive check for "no_dead_ends".
     - **Future Enhancement:** Would involve detailed logic to alter room types, add specific elements, or adjust parameters based on theme and constraints.
   - **`_interact_with_external_tool(self, tool_name: str, tool_input: dict) -> dict`:**
     - **Purpose:** To simulate interaction with external level generation tools (e.g., Unity Muse).
     - **Current Implementation:** Placeholder logic. Logs the intended call and the available tool configuration (from `self.level_design_tool_config`). Returns a mock success response.
     - **Future Enhancement:** Will involve actual API calls to external services or bridges.

### 3. Logging and MCP Interaction:
   - Standard Python `logging` is used for internal agent logging.
   - The agent uses `self.post_event_to_mcp()` to send progress updates and final status (success/failure) to the MCP server. Events include `level_design_progress`, `level_design_complete`, and `level_design_error`.

## Significant Decisions:
   - **Placeholder Focus:** The primary goal was to establish the flow and structure. Complex logic within helper methods is deferred.
   - **Async Operations:** All helper methods involved in the core processing loop are `async` to align with the `BaseAgent` structure and potential future I/O-bound operations (like actual tool calls).
   - **Error Handling:** Basic top-level error handling in `process_task` ensures the agent can report failures gracefully.
   - **Data Structures:** Simple dictionary-based data structures are used for level data and design goals, allowing for flexibility.
   - **Modularity:** The use of helper methods promotes modularity, making it easier to replace placeholder logic with real implementations later.

## Future Work (Implied by Placeholders):
   - Implement robust LLM-based prompt interpretation in `_interpret_design_prompt`.
   - Develop actual procedural generation logic in `_generate_initial_level_structure`.
   - Implement detailed theme and constraint application logic in `_apply_theme_and_constraints`.
   - Integrate actual external tool calls in `_interact_with_external_tool`.
