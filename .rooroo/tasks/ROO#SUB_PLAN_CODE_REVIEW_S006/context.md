# Sub-task: Code Review for src/mcp_server/server_core.py

**Parent Task ID:** ROO#PLAN_CODE_REVIEW_20250519-200706
**Sub-task ID:** ROO#SUB_PLAN_CODE_REVIEW_S006

**Goal for rooroo-developer:**
Review the Python file at `src/mcp_server/server_core.py`.
1. Read the file.
2. Review for:
    * Up-to-dateness (Python 3 features, modern practices, library versions).
    * Efficiency (algorithmic, resource usage).
    * Redundancy (within file and project-wide if obvious).
    * Proper commenting (docstrings for all public modules, classes, functions/methods; inline comments for complex logic).
    * Readiness for deployment (robust error handling, comprehensive logging, clear configuration points, overall clarity and maintainability).
3. Identify areas for improvement. Suggest changes or apply straightforward, low-risk ones. Note complex changes for separate tasks.
4. List all external libraries imported/used in this file.
5. Note any code patterns, algorithms, or complex logic that could benefit from comparison with established best practices or examples (potentially using GitHub MCP or context7).

**Input File:**
*   [`src/mcp_server/server_core.py`](src/mcp_server/server_core.py)

**Guidance:**
*   Focus on the specific file mentioned.
*   If significant refactoring is needed, describe the proposed changes rather than implementing them directly in this review task.
*   The output of this task should be a report detailing findings, suggestions, and any minor changes made. If external libraries are found, list them. If areas for deeper research (GitHub MCP, context7) are identified, specify them.
