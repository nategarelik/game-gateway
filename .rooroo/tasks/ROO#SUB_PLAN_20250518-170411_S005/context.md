# Sub-Task: ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S005
## Parent Task: ROO#NAV_PLAN_20250518-170411
## Goal for Expert (rooroo-developer):
Integrate the external toolchains (Unity Muse, Retro Diffusion Pipeline) as specified in the implementation plan. This includes building interfaces for agent interaction with these toolchains and ensuring they can be invoked and managed via the MCP server.

## Key Design Document:
- [`integrated_toolchains_implementation_plan.md`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_S004/integrated_toolchains_implementation_plan.md)

## Dependencies:
- ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S001 (Core MCP Server Implementation)
- ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S002 (Level Architect Agent - may use Unity Muse)
- ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S003 (Pixel Forge Agent - may use Retro Diffusion)

## Expected Outcome:
Functional integration of external toolchains, accessible to relevant agents through the MCP server.
