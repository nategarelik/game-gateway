# Agent MCP Integration Report: LevelArchitectAgent

**Task ID:** ROO#SUB_20250520-024601_S003
**Date:** 2025-05-20

## Summary of Integration

This task focused on integrating the `LevelArchitectAgent` with the MCP (Master Control Program) Server. The key achievements include:

1.  **Agent Registration:**
    *   The `LevelArchitectAgent` ([`src/agents/level_architect_agent.py`](src/agents/level_architect_agent.py:0)) was equipped with a `start_and_register()` method that calls the `register_with_mcp()` method inherited from `BaseAgent` ([`src/agents/base_agent.py`](src/agents/base_agent.py:0)).
    *   The MCP server's `/api/v1/register_agent` endpoint ([`src/mcp_server/api/routes.py`](src/mcp_server/api/routes.py:0)) now correctly stores agent information in `request.app.state.registered_agents`, initialized in [`src/mcp_server/main.py`](src/mcp_server/main.py:0).

2.  **Task Initiation and Management:**
    *   The MCP's `/api/v1/request_action` endpoint was updated to check for agent registration and to initialize a task within the `StateManager` ([`src/mcp_server/core/state_manager.py`](src/mcp_server/core/state_manager.py:0)). Direct invocation of the agent's `process_task` method from this endpoint is currently simulated; the actual call is handled by the test script.
    *   The `StateManager`'s `_process_request_node` was enhanced to log and store information from agent events passed via `invoke_graph_update`.

3.  **Event Handling:**
    *   The MCP's `/api/v1/post_event` endpoint was modified to extract `task_id` from incoming agent events and use it to call `state_manager.invoke_graph_update()`. This allows agent-reported progress and results to update the corresponding task's state in the MCP.
    *   The `LevelArchitectAgent` already correctly includes `task_id` in its event payloads sent via `post_event_to_mcp`.

4.  **Test Scenario:**
    *   A test script, [`scripts/run_level_architect_scenario.py`](scripts/run_level_architect_scenario.py:0), was created. This script:
        *   Instantiates the `LevelArchitectAgent`.
        *   Registers the agent with the (assumed running) MCP server.
        *   Sends an action request to the MCP.
        *   Manually calls the agent's `process_task` method with the `task_id` from the MCP.
        *   Polls the MCP's `/api/v1/task_status/{task_id}` endpoint to observe the task's progression as updated by agent events.

5.  **Documentation:**
    *   [`docs/agents/level_architect.md`](docs/agents/level_architect.md:0) was updated with a section detailing its MCP integration.
    *   [`docs/mcp_server/api.md`](docs/mcp_server/api.md:0) was updated with a note on how agent events affect task states.

## Next Steps / Considerations

*   **Direct Agent Invocation:** The MCP's `/request_action` currently doesn't directly invoke the agent's `process_task`. A mechanism for the MCP to look up the agent instance (if in the same process) or call its registered endpoint (if a separate service) needs to be implemented for a more complete automated workflow.
*   **Agent Task Polling:** If agents are to run independently, they would need a mechanism to poll the MCP for assigned tasks.
*   **Error Handling and Resilience:** Further enhancements to error handling in both agent and MCP communication.
*   **Advanced State Management:** The `StateManager` graph could be made more sophisticated to model the agent interaction lifecycle more accurately (e.g., distinct states for "dispatched_to_agent", "agent_processing", "agent_completed", "agent_failed").
