**Specific Components to Build / Integrate:**
1.  **Pixel Forge Agent:**
    *   Implement its class structure (inheriting from `BaseAgent`), core logic for asset generation (e.g., image, texture, simple models via placeholders), MCP integration, prompt mechanisms, and comprehensive unit tests.
    *   Document its functionality in `docs/agents/pixel_forge_agent.md`.
2.  **Documentation Sentinel Agent:**
    *   Implement its class structure, core logic for monitoring documentation sources and processing updates (potentially linking with Knowledge Management), MCP integration, prompt mechanisms, and unit tests.
    *   Document its functionality in `docs/agents/documentation_sentinel.md`.
3.  **Integrated Toolchains:**
    *   **Unity Muse Integration:** Develop Python interfaces/wrappers to (conceptually for now, if direct API access is complex) interact with Unity Muse for tasks like scene assembly, material generation, or animation guidance. This should be callable by agents.
    *   **Retro Diffusion Pipeline:** Develop Python interfaces/wrappers for the Retro Diffusion Pipeline for 2D asset generation.
    *   Ensure these toolchains can be invoked by relevant agents (e.g., Pixel Forge, Level Architect) via the MCP or direct interaction logic.
    *   Document the integration points and usage in `docs/toolchains/`.
4.  **Style Enforcement System:**
    *   Implement core components: Palette Validation Middleware (callable during asset generation), Procedural Animation Rules (conceptual rules engine), and style consistency checks.
    *   Integrate this system with asset generation agents (Pixel Forge).
    *   Document in `docs/systems/style_enforcement.md`.
5.  **Knowledge Management (Real-Time Doc Processing):**
    *   Implement the system for monitoring specified documentation sources (e.g., local markdown files, URLs - placeholder for URL fetching).
    *   Implement (placeholder) vectorization of document chunks and a simple mechanism for update propagation or agent notification (e.g., via Documentation Sentinel and MCP events).
    *   Document in `docs/systems/knowledge_management.md`.
6.  **Autonomous Iteration Workflow (Playtest Analysis Loop):**
    *   Implement (placeholder) metrics collection from simulated playtests.
    *   Develop basic analysis components (e.g., identifying common failure points from mock playtest data).
    *   Implement optimization trigger mechanisms (e.g., suggesting tasks for Level Architect based on analysis).
    *   Document in `docs/workflows/autonomous_iteration.md`.
7.  **Emergent Behavior Protocols:**
    *   Implement a basic Creative Conflict Resolution mechanism (e.g., if two agents propose conflicting designs, a simple priority or voting rule, or flagging for human review via MCP event).
    *   Implement Dynamic Tool Composition (e.g., an agent deciding to use ToolA then ToolB based on task state - placeholder logic).
    *   Document in `docs/protocols/emergent_behaviors.md`.
8.  **Advanced Agent Behaviors and Collaboration:**
    *   Implement basic Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocols (e.g., one agent requesting assistance from another via MCP tasking).
    *   Implement simple Real-Time Communication/Feedback mechanisms (e.g., agents posting status events that other interested agents can subscribe to via MCP - conceptual subscription).
    *   Document in `docs/protocols/advanced_collaboration.md`.
9.  **Extensibility and Integration:**
    *   Design and implement basic Plug-and-Play Tool Support (e.g., a way to register new tool interfaces with the MCP or agents).
    *   Design and implement (placeholder) Custom Workflow Nodes for LangGraph within the MCP's `StateManager`.
    *   Document in `docs/systems/extensibility.md`.
10. **System-Wide Testing:**
    *   After implementing the above, develop and execute 1-2 basic end-to-end test scenarios (e.g., in `scripts/`) that involve:
        *   MCP assigning a high-level task.
        *   Multiple agents collaborating (e.g., Level Architect designs, Pixel Forge creates assets).
        *   Use of at least one (mocked) integrated toolchain.
        *   Generation of events and state updates in the MCP.
    *   Document these test scenarios and their expected outcomes.

**General Guidelines for `rooroo-developer`:**
*   Prioritize creating functional, integrated components. Use placeholders for complex external interactions (LLMs, specific APIs) if direct implementation is too time-consuming for this pass, but ensure the interface for them is defined.
*   Create all necessary Python files, test files, and documentation files in the appropriate project structure (`src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`).
*   Write unit tests for new Python components.
*   **Ensure all documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date with the implemented code.**
*   **Verify that all code will function as intended. Leverage the `context7` MCP to fetch the latest documentation for any external libraries or APIs used to ensure compatibility and correctness. For example, if using `httpx`, use `context7` to get its latest API details before writing code that uses it.**
*   You have the autonomy to break this down into logical implementation steps internally. The goal is a significant push towards a complete system.
*   Provide a comprehensive report upon completion, detailing all artifacts created/modified, the overall status of the system, and any major roadblocks or areas requiring further attention.
