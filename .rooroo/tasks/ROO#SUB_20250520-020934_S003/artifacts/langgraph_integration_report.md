# LangGraph Integration Report

**Task ID:** ROO#SUB_20250520-020934_S003
**Date:** 2025-05-20

## Summary
This task focused on the initial integration of LangGraph into the MCP server for managing the state of ongoing tasks. The core components implemented include a Pydantic model for task state, a `StateManager` class to encapsulate LangGraph logic, a simple LangGraph workflow, and placeholder integration with API endpoints. Basic unit tests were also added.

## Key Accomplishments:

1.  **Core State Model (`ManagedTaskState`):**
    *   Defined in [`src/mcp_server/models/managed_task_state.py`](src/mcp_server/models/managed_task_state.py).
    *   Includes `task_id`, `current_step`, `status`, `history`, `agent_responses`, and `error_info`.

2.  **`StateManager` Class:**
    *   Implemented in [`src/mcp_server/core/state_manager.py`](src/mcp_server/core/state_manager.py).
    *   Manages LangGraph instances using an in-memory `MemorySaver` checkpointer.
    *   Methods:
        *   `initialize_task_graph()`: Creates and compiles a new graph instance.
        *   `invoke_graph_update()`: Runs the graph instance (for the simple graph, it runs to completion).
        *   `get_graph_state()`: Retrieves the current state of a task's graph.
    *   Defines a simple graph with `start_task`, `process_request`, and `END` nodes.

3.  **API Integration (Placeholder):**
    *   Modified [`src/mcp_server/api/routes.py`](src/mcp_server/api/routes.py):
        *   The `/request_action` endpoint now initializes and invokes a LangGraph task via the `StateManager`. The request ID is used as the `task_id`.
        *   A new endpoint `/task_status/{task_id}` was added to retrieve the state of a specific task using `state_manager.get_graph_state()`.
    *   The `StateManager` instance is created globally in `routes.py` for now.

4.  **Unit Tests:**
    *   Added to [`tests/mcp_server/test_state_manager.py`](tests/mcp_server/test_state_manager.py).
    *   Tests cover:
        *   Graph initialization.
        *   Invocation and state transition of the simple graph.
        *   State retrieval.
        *   Handling of non-existent task IDs.

## Files Created/Modified:

*   **Created:**

    *   [`tests/mcp_server/test_state_manager.py`](tests/mcp_server/test_state_manager.py)

*   **Modified:**
    *   [`src/mcp_server/models/__init__.py`](src/mcp_server/models/__init__.py) (to include `ManagedTaskState`)
    *   [`src/mcp_server/core/state_manager.py`](src/mcp_server/core/state_manager.py) (major implementation)
    *   [`src/mcp_server/api/routes.py`](src/mcp_server/api/routes.py) (to integrate `StateManager`)

## Next Steps / Considerations:

*   **Asynchronous Graph Execution:** The current `invoke_graph_update` runs the simple graph synchronously. For long-running tasks or agent interactions, true asynchronous execution and callbacks will be needed.
*   **Complex Graph Logic:** The current graph is very basic. Future tasks will involve more complex graphs with conditional edges, agent invocation nodes, and human-in-the-loop steps.
*   **Persistent Checkpointing:** Graph states are currently in-memory. A persistent checkpointer (e.g., `langgraph-sqlite` or a custom database solution) will be required for production.
*   **Error Handling in Graph:** More robust error handling within graph nodes and propagation to the `ManagedTaskState`.
*   **Configuration:** How graphs are defined and configured (e.g., dynamically based on task type) needs further design.

This initial integration provides a foundational layer for using LangGraph to manage complex, stateful operations within the MCP server.
