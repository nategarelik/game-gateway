# Sub-Task Context: ROO#SUB_183202_S004
## Parent Task ID: ROO#NAV_PLAN_20250518-183202
## Depends on: ROO#SUB_183202_S001, ROO#SUB_183202_S002, ROO#SUB_183202_S003
## Goal for rooroo-documenter:
Create comprehensive documentation detailing the setup process for the Python AI agent ecosystem and its integration with a Unity project for testing. Include basic test cases to verify functionality.

**Specifics to Document:**
1.  **Python Environment Setup:**
    *   How to set up the Python environment (if any special considerations beyond standard Python).
    *   How to run the modified MCP server ([`mcp_server_core.py`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S001/mcp_server_core.py) from task `ROO#SUB_183202_S002`).
    *   Location of agent scripts and toolchain integrations.
2.  **Unity Project Setup:**
    *   How to integrate the C# client (from `ROO#SUB_183202_S003`, e.g., `MCP_Client.cs`) into a Unity project.
    *   Configuration of the C# client (server address, port).
3.  **Basic Test Cases (from within Unity):**
    *   **Test Case 1: MCP Server Ping/Status Check.** Describe how to make a simple call from Unity to the MCP server to verify it's running and reachable (e.g., a `/ping` or `/status` endpoint). Detail expected request and response.
    *   **Test Case 2: Basic Agent Invocation.** Describe how to make a call from Unity to invoke one of the simpler agents (e.g., Documentation Sentinel or a basic function of Level Architect) via the MCP server. Detail expected request parameters, agent action, and response.
4.  **Troubleshooting:** Briefly mention common issues and how to address them.

**Key Input References:**
*   Communication Architecture Design: Artifact from `ROO#SUB_183202_S001`
*   Modified MCP Server details: Artifacts from `ROO#SUB_183202_S002`
*   Unity C# Client details: Artifacts from `ROO#SUB_183202_S003`

**Expected Output Artifact:**
*   A Markdown document (e.g., `Unity_Integration_Setup_Guide.md`) in this task's artifact directory.
