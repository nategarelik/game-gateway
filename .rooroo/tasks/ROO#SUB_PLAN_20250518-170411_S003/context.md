# Sub-Task: ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S003
## Parent Task: ROO#NAV_PLAN_20250518-170411
## Goal for Expert (rooroo-developer):
Implement the "Pixel Forge" specialized agent. This involves developing the agent's core logic, integrating its role-specific prompt templates, and defining its behavior enforcement mechanisms based on the design document. Ensure the agent can interface with the MCP server.

## Key Design Document:
- [`specialized_agent_roles_and_prompt_systems.md`](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_PLAN_S002/specialized_agent_roles_and_prompt_systems.md) (Focus on Pixel Forge sections)

## Dependencies:
- ROO#SUB_PLAN_20250518-170411_S001 (Core MCP Server Implementation)

## Expected Outcome:
A functional "Pixel Forge" agent capable of performing its designated tasks within the ecosystem and communicating with the MCP server.
